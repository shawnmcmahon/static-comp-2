# Static Comp 2

## Description
The learning goal for this project was to test our ability to recreate a comp as close to the original as we can. We were given liberty to change the theme of the comp but we were instructed to keep the layout the same. For the theme, I decided
to make a list of the Top 10 Billboard Artist of the 2010's decade. The second learning goal was to get more practice with mobile-first, responsive design. This
project works on a variety of screen sizes and resolutions.

## How it works
- In your terminal and inside the desired directory,
type 'Git clone 'Git clone git@github.com:shawnmcmahon/static-comp-2.git'
- Inside the static-comp-2 directory,
type 'Open index.html'
- The comp will open within a browser
